Hello, this is my shell variables, init and expansion directory
the task 0 is creating an alias named ls with the value rm *. Pleas do not run this code anhow you want because it may just delete all your files.
The task 1 is creating a script that says hello user, note that it will call out the current user, that is if Nelson is the user it will print hello Nelson.
